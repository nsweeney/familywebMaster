$ cd (into directory you want to copy project into)

$ git clone 'paste URL here no quotes'

$ git log     //shows github commits

//if no rails -v
gem install rails

//if you copy this to another machine other than original one
//use this command to install dependencies
$ bundle

//this one to setup databases
//this database woulnt have some info as one created on the 
//other machine, this just creates an empty db for use with app
$ rake db:create:all
$ rake db:migrate   //migrates in the info we created with rails g scaffold status name:string content:text

//In this app we copied in bootstrao css, javascript and images to assets folder for use

// use devise to create login authentication system
//add gem 'devise' in the below area of the Gemfile
///////////////////////////////////////////////
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.2.13'

# Bundle edge Rails instead:
# gem 'rails', :git => 'git://github.com/rails/rails.git'

gem 'sqlite3'
gem 'devise'
///////////////////////////////////////////////

//next we type bundle in console to install that new gem
$bundle
 
//now we install devise
$rails generate devise:install
//follow instructions after install of devise

// now we use devise to create user model for this app ("user" being the name we gave the model ) - one thing this does is create db table with fields and types
$rails generate devise user

//add these 3 (t.string)lines to the new migrate file
class DeviseCreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table(:users) do |t|
      # Only thing I added was the below 3 lines.
      t.string :first_name
      t.string :last_name
      t.string :profile_name
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//now we add the migration to db with-
$rake db:migrate
 
//find new routes for use with-
$rake routes

//install devise views so we can edit them to our liking
$rails generate devise:views

//will modify signup page at views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb
//we added some fields (first name, last name, username) so we must add those like this to models/user so they can be assigned without error
*attr_accessible :email, :password, :password_confirmation, :remember_me, :first_name, :last_name, :profile_name

//we can load a rails app into an interactive console like this (irb) * shutdown server FIRST!
$rails console
irb> user = User.first 	//find first user
irb> user.destroy		//delete that chosen user
irb> exit				//leaves console
